# ToDo App

Currently, a user can add todo tasks to the proof-of-life starter application. In this phase, we will add hard-wired, default context settings to the application so that the user can view three incomplete todo tasks. In addition, the user will have the option of viewing any additional incomplete tasks by using pagination functionality.
